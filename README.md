# 05_API_homework_disaster NO LONGER!</br></br>
This was one where I was totally stumped on my first hand in.  
I remember being very frustrated, I think I left some hashed out notes in the code.  
I had no issues this time... other than how horribly the forecast looks.
</br></br>
The most recent file "Homework_APIs_Retry.ipynb" is the one I'm handing in this time.

Thank you!
